## Description
As a barista, I wanted to create a website for my workplace, which currently doesn't have an online presence.
This project is still a work in progress, and I'm enjoying the process of building it from scratch
also it might be relatively basic at the moment.
However, I'm actively working to improve and expand its features to provide a better experience for visitors.
## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

## Tools Required:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

  
As of now, my web development skills are limited to front-end technologies. 
I am actively learning and plan to expand my knowledge to include JavaScript.
